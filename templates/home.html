    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <p>A learning space for myself and others.</p>

    <p>I'm interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies, the concept and application of blockchain,

    coins, tokens, smart contracts, exchanges. By building this project myself, I can understand the value and flaws and if it's worth it.</p>

    <p>For others it can be a space to play around and learn without investing real money.</p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Develop a working blockchain that works similar to the hundreds of 'real' blockchains, with coins, tokens, smart contracts.
            This blockchain is not meant to replace 'the big chains' but to become a place of learning and experimentation.</li>
        <li>Practice my existing software development skills, learn new skills, technics and tools.
            A project like this makes uses of several technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, JSON, SQLite, Criptography and Networking to name a few.
            I'm experienced in all of them and this project is a way to combine them in a way that would be used in a real life scenario.</li>
        <li>Evaluate what technologies add value to the project and reject those that are unnecessarily complex.
            A new hot language or framework may or may not be the best tool for the job.
            I decide what to use by evaluating the present and future benefits to the project versus the risks and cost.</li>

        <li>Provide users with a working understanding of what they can do with all the services provided. Does it provide something useful or is it hype?</li>
    </ul>
